# Mychat- Firebase-Chat-Application

This was a side project I decided to developed after learning java and android studio.
The application uses the realtime Database provided by Firebase to store a user's information.
It also implements the ocr reader api provided by Google.

So far, implementation of the location feature is still in progress. (As of 2/18/2018)
